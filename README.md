* [Specmatic Website](https://specmatic.in)
* [Specmatic Documenation](https://specmatic.in/documentation.html)

This sample project demonstrates how we can practice contract-driven development and contract testing in a GraphQL (Kotlin) API that depends on an external domain service. Here, Specmatic is used to stub calls to domain API service based on its OpenAPI specification.
